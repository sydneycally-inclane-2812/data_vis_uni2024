# data_vis_uni2024

This is the repository for the data and code behind my work for the Visual Analytics Individual Assignment class, taught by Dr. Khimji. 
Important files include:
- `analysis.ipynb`: the main analytics and visualization file
- `requirements.txt`: libraries needed to run the code
- `raw_data`: aggregated through many sources
- `cleaned_data`: fixed column name mismatch and reorder to be uniform, easier for data analysis
- `presentation.pptx`: presentation file, complete with analysis and visualizations
